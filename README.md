# 🔐 Authentication & Security

* JWT-based authentication
* Secure login system
* Protected routes (frontend)
* Role-Based Access Control (ADMIN / MANAGER / STAFF)
* Session handling with auto logout
* BCrypt password encryption
* Method-level security

---

# 🛎 Reservation Management

Full CRUD operations:

* Create reservation
* View reservations
* Update reservation
* Delete reservation
* Pagination support

### Business Rules

* Check-in date must be before check-out date
* Prevent overlapping room bookings
* Reservation status transitions enforced

---

# 🔄 Booking Lifecycle (Enterprise Feature)

Reservation states:

PENDING → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED  
        ↘ CANCELLED  

### Automation

- Reservations automatically move to **COMPLETED** after checkout date
- Implemented using scheduled backend jobs
- No manual intervention required

### Business Impact

- Accurate reservation tracking
- Real-world hotel workflow simulation
- Enables correct revenue calculation

---

# 👥 Admin Panel

Admin capabilities:

* View all users
* Create new users
* Update user roles
* Role-based UI restriction

---

## ⚙️ Pricing Management (Admin Feature)

Admin can:

- Add special pricing (festival / peak days)
- Update pricing multiplier
- Delete pricing rules

### Key Advantage

- No code changes required
- Fully dynamic pricing system

---

# 📊 Dashboard & Analytics

* KPI cards (Total reservations, Active bookings)
* Reservation trends (monthly)
* Revenue analytics
* Occupancy analytics

Built using:

* Recharts

---

## 💸 Price Preview (User Feature)

Before booking, users can:

- Preview total price
- See pricing impact based on selected dates
- Understand difference between base and final price

### Benefits

- Transparent pricing
- Better user experience
- Reduces booking confusion

---

# ⚙ Backend Features

* REST API architecture
* JWT authentication & authorization
* Global exception handling
* Analytics endpoints
* Flyway database migrations
* Swagger API documentation
* Spring Boot Actuator monitoring

---

## 💰 Dynamic Pricing Engine

Pricing is calculated **per day**, not static.

### Pricing Rules

- Weekdays → Base price
- Weekends → +20% surge
- Special/Festival pricing → Custom multiplier
- Festival pricing overrides weekend pricing

### Architecture

ReservationService → PricingService → SpecialPricingRepository

### Key Highlights

- Null-safe pricing (no crashes if data missing)
- Extendable for demand-based pricing
- Admin-controlled pricing via UI

---

# 🗄 Database

* MySQL
* Flyway migrations
* Relational schema (Users, Reservations, Rooms)

---

## 📈 Revenue Calculation Logic

Revenue includes only:

- CONFIRMED reservations
- COMPLETED reservations

Excluded:

- PENDING
- CANCELLED

### Why This Matters

- Ensures financial accuracy
- Matches real-world hotel revenue tracking

---

# 🐳 DevOps & Tools

* Docker & Docker Compose
* Swagger / OpenAPI
* Spring Boot Actuator

---

## 🔁 Booking Flow

1. User creates reservation → PENDING
2. (Future: payment integration) → CONFIRMED
3. After checkout → automatically COMPLETED
4. User/Admin can cancel → CANCELLED

---
